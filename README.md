# A Spring jpa course project
+ This course project taught me how to work with data with business layer.
+ Back in the days I struggled to use (@manyToOne, @OneToMany) annotations. However, by completing this course I have become more confident about them.
+ There are some entities that are needed to be connected to db, some aren't. For that he built every class from scratch to make sure we undersood the process.
